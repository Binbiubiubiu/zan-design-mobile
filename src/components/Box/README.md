## Box

### Introduction

The Box component is actually a wrapper for the div element, which is provided for friends with `code obsessive-compulsive disorder` (can't see the mixed case of JSX).

<Alert type="info">
  The Box component supports receiving all the Props attributes of the div element, which can be processed directly as a div.
